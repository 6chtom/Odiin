# Power Overwhelmiing

> An attempt at emulating NFC 14443-A devices on the Nordic Semiconductors nRF52840 SoC platform.

## Description

**[nRF52840 M.2 Developer Kit](https://store.makerdiary.com/products/nrf52840-m2-developer-kit)** is a versatile IoT prototyping platform, including the [nRF52840 M.2 Module](https://store.makerdiary.com/products/nrf52840-m2-module) and [M.2 Dock](https://wiki.makerdiary.com/m2-dock). You can use the developer kit to prototype your IoT products and then scale to production faster using the nRF52840 M.2 Module combined with your custom PCB hardware.

The [nRF52840 M.2 Module](https://store.makerdiary.com/products/nrf52840-m2-module) is a removable M.2 E-Key form factor module based on the nRF52840 SoC, supporting Bluetooth 5, Bluetooth mesh, Thread, Zigbee, 802.15.4, ANT and 2.4 GHz proprietary stacks.

The [M.2 Dock](https://wiki.makerdiary.com/m2-dock) extends the interfaces compared to the nRF52840 M.2 Module through an M.2 E-Key connector. This design also features a fully-integrated [DAPLink](https://armmbed.github.io/DAPLink/) debugger with [Power Profiling](https://wiki.makerdiary.com/nrf52840-m2-devkit/power-profiling), enabling you to program, debug and perform real-time current profiling of your applications without using external tools.

## Current Hardware

Currently POmiing is being developed on a [nRF52840 M.2 Developer Kit](https://store.makerdiary.com/products/nrf52840-m2-developer-kit) by makerdiary. Their hardware has so far been wonderful and a great way to dive into the nRF52 family of System on a Chips.

For debugging and logging, I'm just using a [USB to TTL](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12977) device for now, so I can maintain the connection through device reboots.

## Build Environment

A vast majority of the code in this repository is designed to be cross compiled from any platform. This section will discuss some of the tools you'll need on your path. With the exception of perhaps Python depending on how you install it, you'll need to add all these tools to your path manually, or use full paths.

 I'm currently targeting an ARM device, and making use of the [GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads) 9-2020-Q2 on Windows. Look in `BuildSettings.mk`, and set your paths in there accordingly. If you're using VS Code, you may want to update the path to your install in `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json` as well, as it's used for the C++ plugin to generate error squigglies. You may very well have luck building with other tools or on other platforms, but at this point in the project life-cycle, that's an exercise left to the reader.

I'm using Visual Studio Code as my primary editor, and have provided a .vscode folder with tasks I'm performing often to build/flash/etc. Those tasks use the GNU `make` to run. You'll need `make` on your path (I'm using the latest from [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/make)), as well as the [nRF5x-Command-Line-Tools for Win32](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-Tools/Development-Tools/nRF-Command-Line-Tools/Download#infotabs).

You'll need `python` 3, and a few tools to finish building and flash. Where you install Python from is not important as long as it's on your path (and probably your Scripts directory, too.) In either user space or in a venv, you'll want to `pip install` at least `pyocd`, `intelhex`, and maybe `adafruit-nrfutil` if you're tinkering with the bootloader.

###### Make sure to `git submodule update --init` after checking out this repo!

## Contributing

Contributions are absolutely welcome. In this early state, the project is majorly in flux. Things are mostly added ad-hoc and without planning right now, as this has been mostly a learning exercise as much as it has been to share.

That said, everyone is more than welcome to report issues, make suggestions, or if it fancies you to fork and make a PR, go for it! Even if it's just for a typo.
